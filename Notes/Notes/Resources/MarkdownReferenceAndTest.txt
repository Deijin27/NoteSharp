# Markdown Reference and CSS Test

Markdown is a syntax for describing rich-text components via clean and readable plaintext.

Paragraphs are separated by an empty line.

## Headings

Headings are done with hash chars like this.

``` 
# First Level Head

## Second Level Head

### Third Level Head

#### Fourth Level Head

##### Fifth Level Head

###### Sixth Level Head
``` 
# First Level Head

## Second Level Head

### Third Level Head

#### Fourth Level Head

##### Fifth Level Head

###### Sixth Level Head

## Soft Linebreak

In markdown a single newline is normally ignored. For a soft linebreak (e.g. for dialoges in literature), add two spaces at the end of the line before adding the newline.

She said: "Hello"  
He said: "again"

## Emphasis

``` 
For italic text use one *asterix* or one _underscore_.
```

``` 
For bold text use two **asterix** or two __underscores__.

## Lists

``` 
For an unordered list use a dash

- like 
- this

For an ordered list use whatever number you want and add a dot:

1. like
1. this

Also ordered lists using an alphabetic incrementor:

a. hi
a. hi

A. hi
B. hi

And with roman numerals:

i. hi
ii. hi

I. hi
I. hi
```

## Task Lists

``` 
- [ ] Item1 
- [x] Item2 
- [ ] Item3 
``` 

- [ ] Item1 
- [x] Item2
- [ ] Item3 

## Horizontal Rule

Created with three dashes:

``` 
Hello

---

I am a line
``` 
Hello

---

I am a line

## Links

A web link is automatically converted into a link.

```
https://pokemonshowdown.com/
``` 

https://pokemonshowdown.com/

Or you can have text function as the link.

```
[Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) 
``` 
[Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/)

## Images

The same rules as with links, but with an `!`. These can be links to web image files, or files on your device (`/storage/emulated/0/` is the path to the folder usually called _Internal Storage_). The width or height of the image can also be specified - width as a percentage (of the page width) is often easiest.

``` 
![](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/icon/330.gif){width=15%}
``` 

![](https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/icon/330.gif){width=15%}

You can have an image also function as a link:

``` 
[![](/storage/emulated/0/Snapseed/img.jpg){width=50%}](https://serebii.net)
``` 

[![alt-text](/storage/emulated/0/Snapseed/img.jpg){width=50%}](https://serebii.net)

You can also embed video links!

``` 
![](https://youtu.be/RmHkx9P19hg){width=100%}
```

## Blockquote

Blockquotes are done using a greater-than sign at the start of the line.

``` 
> "My flexible friend" - Mr. Bean
``` 
> "My flexible friend" - Mr. Bean

## Footnotes

Define footnotes and it will be automatically put at the end of the document, then use them anywhere.

``` 
You can write footnotes[^1] with markdown. 

Scroll down to the end of the page[^2] and look for the footnotes. 

[^1]: Thank you for scrolling.
[^2]: This is the end of the page.
```

[^1]: Thank you for scrolling.
[^2]: This is the end of the page.

## Definition List

To create a definition list put the word, then each definition starts with a colon and three spaces.

``` 
Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
the family Rosaceae.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
```

## Tables

``` 
| Name | Species |
| --- | --- |
| Storm | White Cloud Mountain Minnow | 
| Alphonse | Leopard Danio |
``` 

| Name | Species |
| --- | --- |
| Storm | White Cloud Mountain Minnow |
| Alphonse | Leopard Danio |

You can control the alignment of data in a table column using colons.

``` 
| Left Aligned | Right Aligned | Centre Aligned |
| :--- | ---: | :---: |
| 10 | 10 | 10 |
| 1111 | 1111 | 1111 |
``` 

| Left Aligned | Right Aligned | Centre Aligned |
| :--- | ---: | :---: |
| 10 | 10 | 10 |
| 1111 | 1111 | 1111 |


## Code

Backticks are key to making code.


    Let us create some `<?php inlineCode(); ?>` and now let us check, if a codeblock works:

    ```
    using System; 
    class Program 
    { 
        public static void Main(string[] args) 
        { 
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, world! How are you on this fine evening?"); 
        } 
    }
    ```
