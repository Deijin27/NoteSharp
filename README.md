# NoteSharp

Cross platform Markdown notes mobile application, programmed in C# and XAML using Xamarin.Forms.

## Supports (as of 14 August 2021)

- Folder-File system
- Viewing of rendered Markdown
- Create and use your own custom CSS for rendering markdown
- Load other notes as templates or data-sets within a note, where the template is filled in by the values from the data set (More on this in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Deijin27/NoteSharp/wiki))
- Quick Access (more than just a favourites list; has unique behaviour in relation to templates)
- Backup to local files
- Light and Dark theme as well as choice of Accent Color

## Planned

- Search folders individually, and search all folders and file contents on a dedicated search page
- Restore application state on start
